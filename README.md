This app idea is that any user can get the URL for the diagram developed and send it to the reviewer who don't has Cacoo account. The reviewer can leave remarks, notes, comments on the diagram without having to register and login Cacoo.

## Gotchas

I was able to make it working locally, although can't make it working on Vercel deploy since it tells me that token is expired for some unknown reason I can't debug.
